                    Notes on using the sa-systemtap layer

This repository contains a Yocto Project layer which provides a staging area
for systemtap related patches that are currently in the process of being pushed
to their various upstream projects.  Please note that any commits to this
repository should also be pushed up to their respective project.

This layer may be used on top of recent git clones of Yocto/Poky or MEL. At
this time the layer has only been tested on the Beagleboard-XM.


Using this layer with Yocto/Poky:
============================

1. Clone the poky tree, and checkout revision
   0ffb02eec2beaea27ff0ec9d3d31b0a09e675a4c.  Please note that
   older versions may not work due to missing systemtap metadata.  Newer
   versions are untested.

   git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
   cd poky
   git checkout -b <local branch name> 0ffb02eec2beaea27ff0ec9d3d31b0a09e675a4c

2. Source the OE configure script:

   . ./oe-init-build-env

3. Modify conf/local.conf for your particular environment.  Uncomment the line
   "#MACHINE ?= "beagleboard" and add the following line to the end of the
   file:

   IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " systemtap systemtap-uprobes dropbear"

   Note that the minimal Poky image does not contain a SSH server by default.
   Here we are adding the dropbear package to provide SSH access. Make any
   other adjustments to the file as necessary for your configuration.

4. In conf/bblayers.conf add the path to this repository in the BBLAYERS
   variable.  E.g.:

   BBLAYERS ?= " \
  /path/to/sa-systemtap \
  /path/to/poky/meta \
  /path/to/poky/meta-yocto \
  "
  
5. Build the minimal image

   bitbake core-image-minimal

The resulting images should now contain the patches in the sa-systemtap layer.


Using this layer with MEL:
===========================

1. Follow the MEL documentation to configure MEL for the beagleboard, adding
   "-l /path/to/sa-systemtap" to the create-config.py command line.  This
   option will automatically configure the build to include sa-systemtap by
   adding sa-systemtap to bblayers.conf.

2. Add the following line to conf/local.conf:

   IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " systemtap systemtap-uprobes"

   Note that the MEL devel-image contains openssh as the SSH server.  Therefore,
   it is unnecessary to supply an SSH package here. Make any
   other adjustments to the file as necessary for your configuration.

3. Build the devel image:

   bitbake devel-image

The resulting images should now contain the patches in the sa-systemtap layer.


Kernel configuration:
=======================

sa-systemtap enables the following kernel configuration options for proper
systemtap support:

* CONFIG_RELAY
* CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
* CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
* CONFIG_KPROBES
* CONFIG_PROFILING
* CONFIG_TRACEPOINT
* CONFIG_UTRACE


Compiling and running systemtap probes:
=======================================

1. Note the location of your Poky or MEL build output directory, hereafter
   referred to as <build>.  For Poky <build> will be /path/to/poky/build/tmp.
   For MEL, <build> will be /path/to/mel/build_beagleboard_debug.

2. We need to create a sysroot directory for systemtap's use.  We
   base this on the OE sysroot provided by Poky or MEL.  Copy the OE sysroot
   to a temporary directory.

   cp -a <build>/sysroots/beagleboard <path-to-temp-dir>/beagle-sysroot

3. Copy the vmlinux file into the kernel headers directory in the sysroot.
   This is required so that systemtap can access the kernel debug info.

   cp <build>/work/beagleboard-poky-linux-gnueabi/linux-yocto-3.0.22+git1+808b49474268040ab27c8ee687b60807a11547b4_1+368e38c673ffac8b37fc2a2d4c1e4a1e6f8abf19-r3/linux-beagleboard-standard-build/vmlinux <path-to-temp-dir>/beagle-sysroot/usr/src/kernel

3. systemtap must also have access to the debug info for any userspace
   binaries or libraries that are to be traced. Copy any relevant binary files
   (with debug symbols enabled) into the sysroot.  The destination must match
   the actual filesystem on the target.  For example, if the binary to be
   debugged is located on the target at /home/root/foo, then this file must be
   copied to <build>/beagle-sysroot/home/root/foo on the target.

4. Compile the probe using the following command:

   <build>/sysroots/i686-linux/usr/bin/stap -a arm -B CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/codebench/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi- -r <build>/beagle-sysroot/usr/src/kernel -m <probe_name> /path/to/probe_name.stp --sysroot=<build>/beagle-sysroot <additional parameters as specified by the probe>

5. Copy the resulting .ko file to the target.

6. Run the probe.  On the target, execute:

   staprun -u <probe_name>.ko <additional parameters as specified by the probe>
